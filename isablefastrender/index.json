[{"categories":["teams"],"content":"Unsplash Image Credit: Spencer Watson A Better Tomorrow As an independent consultant, I lead technical teams and move the needle for modernization in enterprises. I keep coming back to the idea of what the project looks like for a new team member. What is the architecture? How are pull requests done? What technologies are we using? What tech stack do they want to move towards? When I join a new team, I ask the most important question: How do we deliver software to our users? The answer tells me what I need to know about the team and often the organization. Often times, I hear we don’t have a DevOps person to do the CI/CD. As a result, deployment is ad hoc and “hand-crafted”. No two deployments look the same. And there is a single person tasked with releasing. For the teams where there is little to no idea of DevOps, which for me is a mindset or principle, I start simple. I introduce a build tool, dependency management, and other goodness. Often, there is push back against spending time on things like automation and tests. As a lead, you have to balance the time spent with shipping features. Features? Yes, what we deliver to the users so they can receive value and in my case do there job in an enterprise setting. Here it is, your moment of Zen: The act of shipping features in a reliable way is the most important feature of all.

Often the movies take principles of honor and loyalty and pit them against each other. I sense this conflict at many organizations I visit. They want to ship many features to the users and neglect how to do so in a standard way with quality. Why does this happen? A new button on the application that everyone can see is more tangible than automated builds. Leadership needs to understand the cultural shift to DevOps. But, changing an organization’s culture is a story for another day. This is a slice of my view on enabling teams to deliver quality software often.

Also, many times folks are waiting for a DevOps person to do it. Serious. I even named an antipattern of one person “doing” DevOps after myself, DaveOps™. If you are waiting for someone to come to your team and “do” DevOps, bad news. A single person doesn’t scale. I view projects even before I start them with the understanding that I am going to leave one day. With this mindset, I set out to make sure the entire team is better without me. Deployments. Everyone knows how we deploy. Tester? Analyst? Manager? It doesn’t matter. I start with creating a checklist for how we deploy. I ask folks to contribute to it and keep it up to date. To make this happen I usually have to get the builds automated enough. Enough for folks to run a script or press the button in our CI/CD tool. Part of the deployment checklist includes details of what we are deploying, features. This may include links to JIRA tickets, test script results, CI links. It always includes notes for post deployment. If the unexpected happened that prevented a successful deployment like a production database is down, disk space issue, etc. we want to know. That way we can come back and fix it later and prevent it from happening. Or safeguard against it. Each checklist serves as a log of past deployments. What did we deploy 3 months ago on Friday? (You can deploy on Friday, if you are ready) I can’t remember what I did last week, which why we document deployments. We rotate deployments responsibilities. Everyone deploys. I am here to support you. So is the rest of the team. When everyone deploys, everyone gets comfortable at deploying and it becomes normal. In the future, consider continuous deployments.

When deploying, know who depends on your app and services. Let the teams know ahead of time, communicate. More important, know who you depend on. Document any APIs, databases, etc. that your team depends on. Run pre deployment tests on dependencies. If a service is down that your team needs, should you deploy?

All good right? Well, a new developer is starting, they can deploy fine but they are asking questions about the tech stack. Point them to the architectural design records. Don’t have one? Good place to start Homepage of the ADR GitHub organization. Architectural Design Records (ADR) answer why a certain technical path was taken and or why it was changed. Most of all it gives context. It serves as a history of technical decisions and increases the teams understanding. Remember you may not be on the team one day. Often I have seen new developers come to a team and change the tech stack and problems arise. They didn’t have the context on why a path was chosen and we can’t blame them. I blame us. We gave them no context on the architectural decisions. Architecture diagrams are helpful for understanding as well. Concepts like ADR give more context even to those who have been on the team for awhile. I find myself in conversations with others wondering why we went down a particular path. It is nice to pull up an ADR and see the reasoning. For example, we chose Go for the CLI because in our spikes it performed well and developers can pick it up quickly. Or for the rules engine we rolled our own and wrote in Clojure for the reasons a, b, and c. ADRs also ensure you justify decisions. We are not doing Resume Driven Development (RDD) are we? (A practice where you pick popular frameworks technologies for your resume) ","date":"2020-06-23","objectID":"/a-better-tomorrow/:4:0","tags":["content"],"title":"A Better Tomorrow","uri":"/a-better-tomorrow/"},{"categories":["teams"],"content":"The Past is the Past ADRs are great for documenting the past. What about where the team wants to go in the future. As soon as you build something you discover a better way to build it. Once your code is in production and users are engaging with it you see ways to improve. You hear about a new approach that you can use or a new technology that can make things faster. Or your team has a better understanding of the problem. My favorite reason to change the tech stack is to simplify. What is the least amount of technology we can use to solve the problem. Serverless? Write these ideas and assumptions and how they will help the team. Pick some and try them out. We can call this Architecture Futures or a roadmap with different paths.

At school, we had Apple’s and learned LOGO. Naturally, I went to the University of Virginia and majored in Sociology. That was my rebellion against my folks, I guess. Both of my parents were programmers and frequently I would go to work with them. Punchcards in a loud room. I learned to navigate DOS on their coworkers computers to find games. After University, I eventually enrolled in a bootcamp of sorts for programming. There I learned COBOL and my first job was writing PL/SQL…then COBOL. I quickly picked up Java and joined a small consulting company and did full stack development with Java, JSP, EJBs, Javascript. There was no Stack Overflow, no libraries…what a time to be alive. Most of my career is shaped by the project that went from a death march and working 90 hours or more a week to eXtreme Programming, an agile methodology geared toward certain engineering practices. I am constantly searching for that nirvana of quality software delivery with a sense of urgency. Over the years, I have lead teams as a Scrum Master and Tech Lead. I love being able to improve an enterprise, whether with guerilla grassroots efforts or working with senior leadership. I am incredibly interested in solving problems, sometimes this can best be done with software other times it is improving an organization’s process.
