[{"categories":["introducing"],"content":"Introducing… I finally got around to making a blog. I thought around different tools like Gatsby, Hugo, Netlify, Firebase, etc. In the end it doesn’t really matter. The content is what is important. Excuse the rough edges but I needed to publish something. I spent most of the months deciding on a theme and tweaking each theme I selected. Ridiculous. The content here is about creating. Creating software, creating teams, and maybe my other endeavors. I reference movies, music, memes. I sometimes will intentionally or unintentionally do this in my writing.

At school, we had Apple’s and learned LOGO. Naturally, I went to the University of Virginia and majored in Sociology. That was my rebellion against my folks, I guess. Both of my parents were programmers and frequently I would go to work with them. Punchcards in a loud room. I learned to navigate DOS on their coworkers computers to find games. After University, I eventually enrolled in a bootcamp of sorts for programming. There I learned COBOL and my first job was writing PL/SQL…then COBOL. I quickly picked up Java and joined a small consulting company and did full stack development with Java, JSP, EJBs, Javascript. There was no Stack Overflow, no libraries…what a time to be alive. Most of my career is shaped by the project that went from a death march and working 90 hours or more a week to eXtreme Programming, an agile methodology geared toward certain engineering practices. I am constantly searching for that nirvana of quality software delivery with a sense of urgency. Over the years, I have lead teams as a Scrum Master and Tech Lead. I love being able to improve an enterprise, whether with guerilla grassroots efforts or working with senior leadership. I am incredibly interested in solving problems, sometimes this can best be done with software other times it is improving an organization’s process.
