# Introducing...

I finally got around to making a blog. I thought around different tools like Gatsby, Hugo, Netlify, Firebase, etc. In the end it doesn't really matter.  The content is what is important.

Excuse the rough edges but I needed to publish something. I spent most of the months deciding on a theme and tweaking each theme I selected. Ridiculous.

The content here is about creating.  Creating software, creating teams, and maybe my other endeavors.

I reference movies, music, memes. I sometimes will intentionally or unintentionally do this in my writing.
